# Structural Design Patterns

Structural Design Patterns mainly responsible for assemble object and classes into a larger structure making sure that
these structure should be flexible and efficient. They are very essential for enhancing readability and maintainability
of the code. It also ensure that functionalities are properly separated, encapsulated. It reduces the minimal interface
between interdependent things.

- **Adapter**: It provides us for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface around one of the
  existing classes.
- **Composite**: It wraps a group of objects into a single object.
- **Bridge**: It decouples an abstraction so that two classes can vary independently.
- **Decorator**: It extends the object behavior dynamically at the run time.
- **Facade**: It offers a simple interface to more complex underlying objects.
- **Flyweight**: It decreases the cost of complex object model.
- **Proxy**: It reduces the cost, reduce complexity, and provide the placeholder interface to an underlying object to
  control access.
