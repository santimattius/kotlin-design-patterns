# Behavior Design Pattern

Behavior Design Patterns are responsible for how one class communicates with others.

- **Chain of Responsibility**: It representatives the command to a chain of processing object.
- **Command**: It generates the objects which encapsulate actions of parameters.
- **Interpreter**: It implements a specialized language.
- **Iterator**: It accesses all the element of an object sequentially without violating its underlying representation.
- **Mediator**: It provides the loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of
  their existing methods.
- **Memento**: It restores an object in the previous state.
- **Observer**: It allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
- **State**: It allows an object to modify its behavior when it's internal states changes.
- **Strategy**: It provides one of the families of algorithm to be selected at the runtime.
- **Template Method**: It allows the subclasses to provide concrete behavior. It also defines the skeleton of an
  algorithm as an abstract class.
- **Visitor**: It separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.
